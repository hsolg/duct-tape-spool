# duct-tape-spool
3D model of a duct tape spool

Versions for 36 and 50 mm wide tapes. Print two identical parts and snap
them together through the tape roll. For a stronger attachment, put a piece
of tape inside the hole from one part to the other.

A mini version for 36 mm tape has been added. Print two identical parts and
hold them together. The end of each part will fit into a groove on the other
part. The parts will not stay together by themselves. Wind a length of tape
around the two parts.
